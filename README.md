# S1084 - Auto Tag and Release #

Simple little Windows App to replace Python Script that 

* GIT: Fetches, checks out and pulls in latest Develop
* Works out (or manually enter) next version
* Tags the new version (and pushes the tag)
* Tells user to build all code (hopefully automate this step in future)
* Releases: Copies and renames all output files and archives old one
